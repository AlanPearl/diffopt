## JOSS Reviewer Information

### Finding the full git repo histories
- `diffopt` combined the scope of several subpackages, `multigrad`, `kdescent`, and `multiswarm`. This was intended to satisfy [initial concerns that an individual submission did not satisfy the scholarly effort requirement](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/7218).
- I developed these subpackages separately before combining them into a single repository, which is why `diffopt` has such a short history.
- Their full respective histories can still be found at:

  - https://github.com/AlanPearl/kdescent
  - https://github.com/AlanPearl/multiswarm
